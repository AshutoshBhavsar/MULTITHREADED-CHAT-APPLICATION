## DESCRIPTION:

A classic client-server chat application built in Java that demonstrates the use of multithreading to handle multiple simultaneous connections. Users can connect to a central server and send messages that are broadcast to all other connected clients in real-time.

Core Features:
Centralized Server: Manages all incoming connections and message broadcasting.

Multiple Clients: Supports numerous clients connecting and chatting concurrently.

Real-time Messaging: Messages sent by one client are instantly received by all others.

Multithreading: The server dedicates a separate thread to each client, ensuring non-blocking communication and smooth performance.
